1. Write code to implement the following child process communication -
Create two child processes. Each child process sends their pid to the parent process using pipes and parent process prints them.
You may use wait() to synchronize between the parent process and the child processes

2. Write code to implement the following process tree -

		A
	       / \
              /   \
             B     C
            / \     \
           /   \     \
          D     E     F

Each child process prints their pid and parents pid. Each parent kill their child process after they print their pid

3. Create two producer threads and two consumer threads. Two producer threads produces 50 random numbers each and consumer threads consume them via a buffer of size 20
Write code to implement this producer consumer problem.
